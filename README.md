# web-scrap-word-freq
My job is to do web scraping and word frequency. 
Web Scraping, also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, is a type of data scraping used to gather information from websites. It allows you to retrieve information from a website that you canâ€™t access through an API or other means. Python provides several libraries that make web scraping easier.
One of the most popular libraries for web scraping in Python is Beautiful Soup1. It is used to extract information from HTML and XML files. Beautiful Soup creates a parse tree from the page source code, which can be used to navigate, search, or modify the data.
Another essential Library is  Requests: It is used to make HTTP requests to a specific URL and retrieve the response. Requests provide built-in functionalities for managing both the request and response.
